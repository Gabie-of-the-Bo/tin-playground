# tin-playground
A client-side IDE for the Tin programming language

# Credits
- Ace Editor
- Mathjax
- Julia Mono Font (this one saved me, because Ace editor only works with monospace fonts)

I do not own any of these three projects, only the Tin Programming language and this website are mine. Credit goes the team responsible for each project.
